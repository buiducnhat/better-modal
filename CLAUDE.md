# CLAUDE.md

This file provides general guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) for projects that follow this workflow.

## Documentation Rules

Documentation structure:

```text
docs/
├── brainstorms/      # Long-term memory for exploration outputs
├── plans/            # Long-term memory for implementation plans
├── architecture.md   # Project architecture and system design
├── code-standard.md  # Coding standards and conventions
├── codebase.md       # Codebase map and key files
└── project-pdr.md    # Product requirements and business context
```

**CRITICAL**: Documentation is essential for project success. Always follow these rules:

1. **Always read project documentation first**  
   Before planning or implementing any feature, read project documentation to understand context, requirements, and existing patterns.

2. **Let documentation guide implementation**  
   Use documentation as the source of truth. If documentation conflicts with implementation needs, clarify with the user instead of guessing.

## Workflow Sequences

Select the workflow based on task complexity:

### 0. Project Bootstrap

**Sequence**: `bootstrap` → `write-plan` → `execute-plan`
**Use Case**: New projects or minimal scaffolds that need proper structure, documentation, and conventions before development begins.

### 1. Complex Exploration

**Sequence**: `brainstorm` → `write-plan` → `execute-plan`  
**Use Case**: Ambiguous, complex, or high-risk tasks that require exploration and approach validation before planning.

### 2. Standard Development

**Sequence**: `write-plan` → `execute-plan`  
**Use Case**: Well-defined but complex tasks, major features, or large refactors that need a structured plan.

### 3. Rapid Implementation

**Sequence**: `quick-implement`  
**Use Case**: Small, low-risk tasks where formal planning would be unnecessary overhead.

## Important Reminders

### Interaction Preferences

When asking questions during task execution:

- Prefer interactive prompts with selectable options **when the current interface supports them**.
- For 2-5 choices, prefer concise option menus.
- If interactive options are not available, ask short, focused text questions.
- Pause for a full user response only when:
  - The question requires detailed explanation, or
  - The user needs external context to answer.

### Critical Rules

- Always read project documentation before planning or implementation.
- Ask clarifying questions when documentation is unclear or incomplete.
- Follow every step in each workflow skill; do not skip required steps.
